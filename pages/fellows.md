# **Disaster and Climate Risk Data Fellows**

The fellowship program offers a 6-month placement for climate and disaster risk professionals (data scientists, geospatial analysts, and similar) from selected climate-vulnerable countries to work with the Risk Data Library Standard to access, create and communicate climate risk knowledge with their communities.

During this time, fellows work part-time as World Bank Short-Term Consultants. Through a dedicated program, they learn how to apply and use the Risk Data Library Standard tools and standards in support of World Bank projects and for the benefit of their institution and communities.

The expected outcomes are increased availability, dissemination, and use of climate risk knowledge in climate-vulnerable and fast-growing cities and countries. The activities complement and leverage climate and disaster risk analysis undertaken in those countries by the World Bank.

Disaster and Climate Risk Data Fellows are selected based on their data skills, climate and disaster risk skills, and willingness to support their communities. They receive training and hands-on support throughout the project to become Risk Data Library Standard experts and contribute to improving climate risk analysis using the Risk Data Library.

The fellowship program is managed by the Digital Earth team at GFDRR and supported by a grant from the Swiss Re Foundation.

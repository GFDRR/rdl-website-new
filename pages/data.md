# 1. Risk Data Library catalog (beta)

The [Risk Data Library catalog (beta)](https://jkan.riskdatalibrary.org/datasets/) is an implementation of the Risk Data Library Standard (RDLS) into a simple open data catalog. 

It aims to showcase the value of the RDLS by allowing to search for, compare, and download risk datasets from various risk data sources.

The catalog, curated by the team at the Risk Data Library, is based on the open-source software JKAN.

# 2. Development Data Hub

The [Risk Data Library collection](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/collections/rdl) from the World Bank data catalog contains data used for or produced by disaster and climate risk assessments and curated by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR).

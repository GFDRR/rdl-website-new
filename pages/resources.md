## Risk Data Library Standard Technical Review (January 2023)

This report summarises the findings and resulting recommendations following a technical review of the Risk Data Library Standard (RDLS) by Open Data Services Co-operative. This assessment incorporates the RDLS User Documentation and the two GFDRR GitHub repositories associated with the standard, rdl-docs and rdl-standard.

## Extensible Data Schemas for Hazard, Exposure and Vulnerability Data (2019)

This paper, a background paper for the UNISDR (now UNDRR) Global Assessment Report 2019, gives an overview of the first phase of development of an extensible data schema for hazard, exposure and vulnerability data under the Challenge Fund.

## 2018 (phase 1): Establishing the hazard schema

An international consortium led by British Geological Survey (BGS) undertook the challenge of developing an open schema for multi-hazard scenario footprints in response to recommendations from Solving the Puzzle, and populating it with data for scenarios in Tanzania.

## 2018 (phase 1): Establishing the exposure schema

An international consortium led by the Global Earthquake Model Foundation (GEM) undertook the challenge of developing an open, multi-scale exposure data schema for multi-hazard analysis (GED4ALL) in response to recommendations from Solving the Puzzle. It was populated with data for Tanzania and other selected countries.

## 2018 (phase 1): Establishing the vulnerability schema

An international consortium led by University College London (UCL) EPICentre undertook the challenge of developing an open data schema for multi-hazard, physical fragility and vulnerability relationships, and socioeconomic indicators and indexes in response to recommendations from Solving the Puzzle. The schema was populated with earthquake physical vulnerablity and fragility relationships.

## 2018 (phase 1): Developing a pilot risk visualization dashboard (HEV-E)

GeoSolutions undertook the challenge of developing an open risk data dashbaord in response to recommendations from Solving the Puzzle, intended to visualize the contents of the hazard, exposure and vulnerability schema.

## 2019 (phase 2): Updating the existing schema and developing a modeled loss schema

GEM and UCL EPICentre updated the existing schema and developing a new component to store modeled loss curves and loss maps.

## 2020 (phase 3): Updating the existing for closer integration

GEM and UCL EPICentre further updated the existing schema and refactored the vulnerability schema to establish a unified database and common tables linking all schema.

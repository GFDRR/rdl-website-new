# Climate & Disaster Risk Screening Tools

A collection of scripted tools developed to inform risk analytics for the the World Bankâ€™s Country Climate and Development Report risk screening activities (2022/2023).

The tools collected in this repository allow to:

- Perform spatial analytics of disaster risk for the present period (baseline) based on global datasets

- Combine risk and poverty information into bi-variate maps

- Produce climate risk outlook based on CMIP6 indices

- Present results into an interactive dashboard
